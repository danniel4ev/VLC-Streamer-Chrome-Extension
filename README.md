## How It Works

### 1. **VLC and Chrome Detection**
The installer automatically checks for VLC and Chrome installations in the default locations. If VLC is not found, you can browse to locate it manually.

### 2. **Directory Structure**
The installer creates the following directory structure in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VLCOpener`:
- `extension/`: Contains the Chrome extension files (`manifest.json`, `background.js`, and icons).
- `native_host/`: Contains the native messaging host manifest (`com.vlc.opener.json`).
- `scripts/`: Contains the Python script (`vlc_opener.py`) that handles communication between Chrome and VLC.

### 3. **Native Messaging Host**
The installer registers a native messaging host with Chrome, allowing the extension to communicate with VLC. The host is defined in `com.vlc.opener.json` and uses a Python script to handle the communication protocol.

### 4. **Extension Files**
The installer generates the following files:
- `manifest.json`: Defines the Chrome extension's metadata and permissions.
- `background.js`: Handles the context menu and communicates with the native messaging host.
- Icons: Downloaded from the VLC repository for the extension's icons.

### 5. **Uninstaller**
The installer creates an uninstaller that removes the native messaging host registry entry and deletes the installation directory.
